HW 60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle -- Take notes on in class demonstration
2022-2-7
time spent: 15 min

DISCO:
-involving an actual sorting algorithm is time inefficient

QCC: 
-if i recieved cards, and then gave them away, can I take cards from another thinker

REFLECTION:
-i feel like class today was an interesting way to teach these sorting concepts

THINKER FIRMWARE:
-take cards offered by another thinker
-if you have more than 1 card, split your deck and give each deck to another thinker
-if you have 1 card, return to thinker who gave it to you
-if you have 2 decks, merge the 2 decks (keeping them sorted) and then return
the new deck to the person who gave them to you

how to clean-up:
-solidify rules on who to give the cards to (preferably the people next to you, not across the room)
-dont focus on what the group is doing, only focus on your task at hand
